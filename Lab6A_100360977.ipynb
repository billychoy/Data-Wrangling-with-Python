    "In this lab, you'll clean and explore data on the Star Wars movies. While waiting for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about _Star Wars_ fans. In particular, they wondered: __does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?__\n",
    "\n",
    "The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed _Star Wars_ fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey and received a total of 835 responses.\n",

    "- RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)\n",
    "- Gender - The respondent's gender\n",
    "- Age - The respondent's age\n",
    "- Household Income - The respondent's income\n",
    "- Education - The respondent's education level\n",
    "- Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location\n",
    "- Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response\n",
    "- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "While working on this dataset, feel free to use online resources. [Google](https://www.google.com/), [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/), and the documentation for various packages will help you as you progress through this lab. All data analysts/scientists make extensive use of resources like these as they write code."
